GOAL: Implement the "Cyber Architect" design (as visually confirmed) across all components and fully populate the entire website with the confirmed content data. The resulting website must be professional, futuristic, and fully interactive, matching the "premium" aesthetic we developed.1. Design Transformation (Cyber Architect Theme)Transform the current design to match the visual direction using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion:Global Aesthetic: Maintain Dark Mode dominant (deep Navy/Black). Implement a subtle, animated technical grid or particle effect that spans the entire background for a 3D, digital environment feel.Accent Color: Cyber Green (#64ffda) must be used for all primary highlights, neon glows, and interactive elements.Hero Section:Apply a constant, pulsating neon Cyber Green glow/ring effect to the circular profile picture placeholder.Apply a subtle Cyber Green neon text shadow/glow to the main titles for strong visual impact.Interactivity: Ensure all buttons, project cards, and skill badges have custom, pronounced Framer Motion hover effects (e.g., a glow or slight scale).Section Dividers: Use subtle, dynamic wave-like or circuit-board-style dividers to visually separate the main sections.2. Full Content Population & Data IntegrationPopulate all sections with the final, validated content, prioritizing data accuracy:SectionContent RequirementSkills & TechnologiesImplement the organized grid layout with icons that glow Cyber Green. Critical Content Update: REMOVE 'Node.js' and 'TypeScript' from Backend/DevOps. ADD 'Framer Motion' and 'Tailwind CSS' to the Frontend list.Experience TimelineFully implement the vertical timeline for Infosys and UB. Ensure the timeline track is a thin, glowing Cyber Green line. Highlight Achievements with Badges: Prominently use Cyber Green achievement badges/icons next to key metrics in the Infosys role: $500k cost reduction (use a 💲 icon badge) and 90% reduction in query response time (use a ⚡ icon badge).Projects ShowcaseIntegrate the detailed descriptions, technical tags, and GitHub/Live Demo links for all four featured projects.
