GOAL & DESIGN:
Create a high-impact, professional portfolio website for Shubham Mohole, a Full-Stack Developer and AI/Cloud specialist, targeting recruiters for Backend, Cloud Engineering, and AI Systems roles.

1.  **Aesthetic (The "Amazing" Design):**
    * **Theme:** **Dark Mode** dominant (Navy/Black background).
    * **Accent Color:** **Cyber Green (#64ffda)** or a vibrant Electric Blue for accents, hover effects, and call-to-action elements.
    * **Typography:** Clean, monospaced or sans-serif fonts for a technical, modern feel.
    * **Interactivity:** Incorporate subtle animations using **Framer Motion** for elements entering the viewport (e.g., text fade-up, project cards sliding in) to enhance user experience without being distracting.

2.  **Core Technology:** Use **React** for structure and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

STRUCTURE & SECTIONS:
The website must be a single-page scrollable application with clear, distinct sections:

1.  **HEADER/NAVBAR:**
    * Fixed, sticky navigation linking to all sections (#About, #Skills, #Projects, #Experience, #Contact).
    * Include a subtle Dark Mode/Light Mode **toggle button** (Dark Mode should be the default).

2.  **HERO/HOME (Above the fold):**
    * **Title:** "Shubham Mahesh Mohale"
    * **Sub-Title:** "Full-Stack Developer | Master's in Computer Science (UB) | AI & Cloud Specialist"
    * **Impact Statement:** "Building high-impact, scalable solutions across FinTech, AI/ML, and Cloud Infrastructure."
    * **Feature:** Include a designated circular placeholder for a **professional profile picture (DP)** with a subtle glow/outline in the accent color.

3.  **ABOUT ME:**
    * Present the About text in two columns: narrative on the left, **Top Skills** (JavaScript, React.js, Python, Java, Spring Boot, AI/ML) listed visually on the right using animated skill badges/pills.

4.  **SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES:**
    * Display skills using an organized **Grid System** (e.g., 3-4 columns).
    * **Categories:** Backend/DevOps, Frontend, AI/ML/Cloud, Core CS. Use clear, monochromatic icons (e.g., Docker whale, Python snake) next to each skill name.
    * **Focus:** Highlight the Oracle OCI, Generative AI, and Microservices expertise.

5.  **PROJECTS (Showcase):**
    * Design a visual, alternating-layout showcase (image on left/text on right, then image on right/text on left).
    * **Media Readiness:** For each project card, include a large, clear placeholder area for **uploading a project photo/screenshot or embedding a video link** (e.g., of the Ripple Policy Simulator demo).
    * **4 Top Projects:** Ripple Policy Simulator, LLM-Powered Text-to-Image System, DevSync AI, Infosys Microservices (high-impact feature).

6.  **EXPERIENCE & EDUCATION:**
    * Use a clean, vertical **Career Timeline** for Infosys (2022-2024) and UB (Aug 2024 - Present).
    * **Key Achievement Badges:** Include small, distinct badges next to major bullet points (e.g., a `$ ` icon next to the "$500k cost reduction" achievement).

7.  **CERTIFICATIONS & AWARDS:**
    * Display all Oracle and UB Certificates (Appreciation) in a horizontal, scrollable **card carousel**.
    * **Media Readiness:** Each card must have a placeholder for uploading the **certificate image (like the JPGs you sent)** and a placeholder for the Credential URL/Link.

8.  **CONTACT:**
    * Professional form with fields: Name, Email, Subject, Message.
    * Social/Professional links clearly placed (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email address).

**CONTENT DATA (To be used by the AI to populate sections):** 1. About
About

I’m Shubham Mohole, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo, with 2+ years of professional experience as a Full-Stack Developer at Infosys.

At UB, I’m diving deeper into AI/ML, Computer Vision, Security, and Systems — with hands-on work in diffusion models, anomaly detection using autoencoders, and open-source development (contributions to DjangoCRM).

At Infosys, I built and deployed over 12 scalable Java/Spring Boot microservices powering 5M+ daily financial transactions. I also led frontend development using Angular and React, collaborated across global Agile teams, and optimized database performance using MySQL and Redis. I’ve worked extensively with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure high-availability production deployments.

Open to full-time roles or internships in backend development, cloud engineering, or AI systems, where I can build high-impact, scalable solutions.

 • Developed a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation system leveraging GANs, Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), and Transformer-based architectures (DALL-E inspired).
 • Fine-tuned pretrained models on domain-specific datasets, including COCO Captions, CUB-200 Birds, and Oxford-102 Flowers, achieving improved realism and semantic alignment of generated images.
 • Implemented baseline experiments with DCGAN and StyleGAN to benchmark generation quality and progressively integrated advanced Diffusion models for superior results.
 • Evaluated performance using both qualitative metrics (visual inspection, side-by-side comparisons, human surveys) and quantitative metrics (Fréchet Inception Distance, Inception Score, CLIP-based similarity).
 • Managed computational resources efficiently for large-scale model training and experimentation.
 • Collaborated with design experts to refine textual prompts, improving output alignment with human expectations by 25%.

Ripple Policy Simulator
Ripple Policy Simulator
Ripple Policy Simulator is an interactive Monte Carlo based policy analysis tool built during UB Hacking 2025. It allows policymakers, researchers, and students to explore how economic and environmental policy changes such as minimum wage adjustments, carbon taxes, or housing subsidies affect a simulated population in real time.
The platform provides eight adjustable policy levers, runs dynamic simulations with confidence intervals, and visualizes more than fifteen key socioeconomic metrics including income distribution, emissions, employment, and rent burden. It also integrates AI powered insights using Gemini to explain equity, sustainability, and the distributional impacts of each scenario.
The entire tool is built fully on the frontend using React, XLSX, and Tailwind inspired styling, enabling a fast, interactive experience directly in the browser.
What started as a 36 hour hackathon concept became a fully functional decision support tool for transparent, data driven policy design, helping users understand who gains, who loses, and why.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AI:**
Generate the full React and Tailwind CSS codebase. Use Framer Motion for subtle, professional entrance animations on sections and project cards. Use placeholder files/paths for all media (images/videos/DP) so the user can easily replace them (e.g., `<img src="/assets/shubham_dp.jpg" alt="Shubham Mohale Profile" />`). The code must be production-ready and modular.
